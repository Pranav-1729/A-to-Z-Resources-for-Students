Some basic things need to be covered first and foremost -

1. Network Theory (proper command on kvl kcl, mesh,loop analysis, network theorems,ac and dc etc.)
2. Basic Electronic Devices (diodes, transistors, bjt, mosfet, op amps, etc)

3. Digital Electronics
(solve gate level problems then revise with nptel lecs)

4. Analog Electronics 
(sources - playlist Electronics 1 from Behzad Razavi for theory and gate level numericals for practice)

5. C language
6. MATLAB
7. HDL -> Verilog


Then you can choose a subdomain form -

VLSI Design
Embedded Systems
COmmunications
Signal processing
Wireless communications
RF and Microwave
